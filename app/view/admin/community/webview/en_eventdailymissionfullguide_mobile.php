					<li class="letterA text-italic">Good afternoon, Sis. It is true, there is a difference in the total credit prizes between new users and old users in this event. However, it is important to note that this event was originally designed to accommodate new users, but we are still providing credit prizes to existing Sellon users. We hope you can wait for the next event that will pay attention to old users. Thank you for your understanding. :)</li>
